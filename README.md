This project represent four calsses: Polynom, Monom, Complex-Function, and function Gui.
Our project contains Junit test for all of our classes, and a java doc

Monom:
 In our Monom's class, we have defined monom by the following features:
 -The coefficient of X can only be a decimal number (can also be without a coefficient) 
- It possession should be an integer
 -The power represented by :^
this class has three constructor: copy,String, and Default(gets cofficent and power). 


Polynom:collection of Monoms

 
ComplexFunction:This class represents a ComplexFunction 
each function that not represented as a CF, thorows Excepsion, for Example (PLus,Null,f2); 
 -this class will create CF that are contains Operation and a function.
 - a function can be: Polynom , Monom or a CF.


function Gui-This class helps us to draw our functions, to read functions from file and draw them,
read from file and build a collection of function, and to save our collection of fuctions into a file.
